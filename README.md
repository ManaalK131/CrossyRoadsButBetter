# CrossyRoadsButBetter
Budget Crossy Roads

Sanjana Yasna, Manaal Khurram





# How to Play:
Pick a mode from the starting screen, and avoid collissions between foes going along the road and your avatar. Unlike regular crossy roads, you can move your avatar left and right as well as up and down, and you can only move down 10 steps (so you may have to cross certain roads all at once)
Goal is to reach 3000 steps, after which you receive a congratulations image (check congrats.png)
Cars/zombies pass by progressively faster, and roads also generate faster the more steps you take.
Have fun surviving!
